>Steve's research interests focus on identifying adaptive variation in the genomes of forest trees, and using a combination of experimental studies and statistical modeling to understand how this variation has been shaped by past changes in climate and what this means for future responses. Steve has been working with poplars for over 10 years, and finds them especially valuable for this work because of their compact genome (for a tree!), their ease of propagation, and their huge amount of variation in climate-adaptive traits, especially phenology. You can check out more on the research of Steve and his lab group at the University of Vermont.
