Jason is a population geneticist with a focus on understanding how past population dynamics shape contemporary genetic variation in forest tree species. He completed his PhD at the University of British Columbia, where he worked on demographic history and local adaptation in Sitka spruce. Since moving to Virginia Tech, Jason has primarily focused on population genomics of adaptation in cottonwoods, and on using genomics to advance restoration of the American chestnut
