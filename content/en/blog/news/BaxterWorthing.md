I am a third year PhD student in the Plant Biology department at The University of Vermont. My research seeks to explain how trees sense and react to major shifts in their surrounding environments, such as the onset of drought or the changing of the seasons. Interestingly, poplar trees from different locations often have distinct reactions to the same environmental changes. For example, it is known that poplars sense the arrival of spring by detecting a rise in temperature, which they respond to by initiating new growth. However, the amount of warming required to initiate this new growth varies between poplars from different locations. To explain incongruities like this, I use genetics and genomics to test if there are genetic differences between poplar populations that may help explain differences in the way they interpret environmental signals. Ultimately, I hope that a better understanding of the relationship between trees, their genes, and the surrounding environment will improve predictions of how climate change will affect forest health. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, biking and skiing.
